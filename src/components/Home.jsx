            <h3>Harsha</h3>
            <p>The front-end developer creates interaction and user experience with scripts embedded in a site’s HTML. Everything a visitor to your site sees, clicks, or uses to input or retrieve information is the work of the front-end developer who creates client-side software that brings the site’s design to life. Scripts are downloaded by the browser, processed, and then run apart from the server.</p>

            <h3>Sri</h3>
            <p>This takes equal parts technology and vision. Front-end developers are the bridge between the designer and the back-end programmer, which means they have to be both creative and tech-savvy. Wondering how a designer’s final design becomes a living, breathing site? That’s front-end code in action—code that breaks the design down into components, then delivers information and functionality made possible by the back-end developer.</p>

            <h3>Kota</h3>
            <p>Overall, they’re creating a web-based application that comes as close to a desktop experience as possible. Their focus is on user experience, and the technology they implement will hinge on how well it accomplishes that speed, efficiency, and smooth functionality.</p>
