              <p>What is hard-work? Firstly, it is important to define what hard work is, so that it can later be analysed. Hard work means not just working, but really giving our work our very best effort.</p>
              <p>Work can be several things. It is sometimes used synonymously with employment. Or, work can be anything that requires effort such as housework or working on a relationship.</p>
              <p>Hard work does not have to mean that we find work difficult, arduous or unenjoyable. Working hard can be something exhilarating and enjoyable which feels wonderfully rewarding.</p>
              <p>Hard work is important for many reasons. Below are some of the main ones.

Getting things done: if we work hard, we can get so much more done.
Positivity: giving something our very best effort is a wonderfully positive feeling.
Discipline: working hard teaches us to develop our self-discipline.
No regrets: if we know that we tried our best, we will not have to live with regrets.</p>

            <Col xs={12} sm={4} className="sidebar-section">
              <Image src="assets/dog-people.jpg" />
              <p>Enjoyment: hard work can actually be very enjoyable.
Achievement: sometimes, we do not know all of the amazing things that we can achieve until we work hard.
Required: hard work is often required from us â€“ whether at school or university or when we are working on projects for our boss.</p>
